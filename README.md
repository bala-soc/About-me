## 🧑‍💼 **About Me**

I am an aspiring **SOC Analyst** building strong foundational skills in security monitoring, threat detection, and incident response. I am gaining hands-on experience in analyzing Windows and Sysmon logs, understanding attacker behaviors, and using SIEM tools to investigate security events.

My GitHub portfolio showcases practical, beginner-to-advanced SOC workflows — including log analysis, basic detection engineering, alert investigation, and step-by-step incident handling. Each project is designed to reflect real tasks performed in modern Security Operations Centers, helping me develop into an effective and detail-oriented blue-team defender.
